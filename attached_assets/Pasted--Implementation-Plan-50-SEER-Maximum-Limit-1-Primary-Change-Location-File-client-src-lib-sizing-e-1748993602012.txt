Implementation Plan: 50 SEER Maximum Limit
1. Primary Change Location
File: client/src/lib/sizing-engine.ts
Function: validateEquipmentSpecs()

Current State: Hard-coded SEER validation ranges (13-25) for AC, heat pump, and combo systems
Required Change: Update upper limit from 25 to 50 for all equipment types with cooling capacity

2. Affected Equipment Types
Air Conditioners: Update from (13-25) to (13-50)
Heat Pumps: Update from (13-25) to (13-50)
Combo Systems: Update from (13-25) to (13-50)
Furnaces/Boilers: No change needed (no SEER validation)
3. Client-Side Impact Analysis
Validation Logic (sizing-engine.ts)
Direct Impact: Three case statements need SEER range updates
Message Updates: Warning messages will automatically reflect new range
Behavior Change: Equipment with SEER 26-50 will no longer trigger validation warnings
User Interface (validation-summary.tsx)
No Changes Required: Component dynamically displays validation messages
Automatic Updates: New validation messages will appear correctly
Display Logic: Existing error categorization and display will work unchanged
Equipment Data (equipment-data.ts)
Assessment Needed: Review if any existing equipment has SEER > 25
Data Integrity: Ensure no data inconsistencies with expanded range
Future Equipment: Ready to accommodate high-efficiency units
4. Server-Side Considerations
Route Validation (server/routes.ts)
Current State: Server relies on client-side validation functions
Impact: No direct changes needed - server uses same validation logic
Consistency: Server-side validation will automatically align with client changes
API Responses
Error Handling: Existing error transformation logic will work unchanged
Validation Messages: Updated messages will flow through existing error processing
Response Format: No changes to API response structure needed
5. Schema and Database Impact
Schema Validation (shared/schema.ts)
Current State: No explicit SEER limits in Zod schema
Assessment: Database schema already supports SEER values up to 50+
No Changes Required: Existing real type can handle the extended range
Database Storage
Current Capacity: PostgreSQL real type supports the extended range
Data Migration: No migration needed - existing data remains valid
New Equipment: Ready to store high-efficiency equipment data
6. Testing and Validation Requirements
Regression Testing
Existing Equipment: Verify all current equipment still validates correctly
Edge Cases: Test equipment with SEER exactly at 25, 26, and 50
Error Handling: Ensure proper validation for SEER > 50
User Experience Testing
Warning Display: Verify no unexpected warnings appear for valid high-efficiency equipment
Performance: Confirm no performance impact from validation changes
Equipment Recommendations: Test that high-SEER equipment appears in results
