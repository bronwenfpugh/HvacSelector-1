Create a plan to update the sizing engine to apply derating calculation for furnaces, based on elevation. Also create a plan to update the equipment display logic to show this message: "Listed capacity reflects x% deration due to elevation."

Calculation Logic
Trigger condition: elevation > 1000 AND equipment type = "furnace"
Derating formula: x% = 3% × (elevation - 1000) / 1000

Examples:

2,000 ft elevation = 3% derating
3,500 ft elevation = 7.5% derating
5,000 ft elevation = 12% derating

Display Requirements
Append this text to matching pricebook equipment listings: "Listed capacity reflects x% deration due to elevation."
Replace x with the calculated percentage (rounded to 1 decimal place)
Only show for furnace equipment when elevation > 1,000 feet
Integration Points
Current State:
Elevation field exists in shared/schema.ts as optional number (-3000 to 30000 feet)
Field is validated but not used in calculations in client/src/lib/sizing-engine.ts
No UI form field currently exists

Required Changes:

Modify sizing engine to apply derating calculation for furnaces
Update equipment display logic to show derating message
Ensure derating affects actual capacity calculations, not just display
Technical Specifications
Apply derating to heating capacity only (not cooling)
Derating should affect equipment selection/sizing logic
Message should appear in equipment listings/recommendations
Validate elevation input exists and is > 1000 before applying
Equipment type identification: ensure furnaces are correctly identified in the system
Expected Output Example
Equipment: GMSS960603BN
Goodman - Gas Furnace
Capacity: 80,000 BTU/hr
Derate heating capacity by 6.0% due to elevation.
Effective Capacity: 75,200 BTU/hr
Files to Modify

client/src/lib/sizing-engine.ts - Add calculation logic
Equipment display components - Add derating message
Ensure elevation data flows from input → calculation → display
Please create a plan to implement this elevation derating feature with the exact calculation formula and display text specified above. The plan should update all relevant area (front end, server, database, etc). Do not write any code, just analyze.
