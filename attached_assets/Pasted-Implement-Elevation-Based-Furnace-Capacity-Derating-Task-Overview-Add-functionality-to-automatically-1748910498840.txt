Implement Elevation-Based Furnace Capacity Derating
Task Overview
Add functionality to automatically derate furnace heating capacity based on elevation input when elevation > 1,000 feet.
Required Implementation
1. Calculation Logic

Trigger condition: elevation > 1000 AND equipment type = "furnace"
Derating formula: x% = 3% × (elevation - 1000) / 1000

Examples:

2,000 ft elevation = 3% derating
3,500 ft elevation = 7.5% derating
5,000 ft elevation = 12% derating





2. Display Requirements

Append this text to matching pricebook equipment listings: "Derate heating capacity by x% due to elevation."
Replace x with the calculated percentage (rounded to 1 decimal place)
Only show for furnace equipment when elevation > 1,000 feet

3. Integration Points
Current State:

Elevation field exists in shared/schema.ts as optional number (-3000 to 30000 feet)
Field is validated but not used in calculations in client/src/lib/sizing-engine.ts
No UI form field currently exists

Required Changes:

Add elevation input field to the UI form
Modify sizing engine to apply derating calculation for furnaces
Update equipment display logic to show derating message
Ensure derating affects actual capacity calculations, not just display

4. Technical Specifications

Apply derating to heating capacity only (not cooling)
Derating should affect equipment selection/sizing logic
Message should appear in equipment listings/recommendations
Validate elevation input exists and is > 1000 before applying
Equipment type identification: ensure furnaces are correctly identified in the system

5. Expected Output Example
Equipment: XYZ Furnace Model ABC
Heating Capacity: 80,000 BTU/hr
Derate heating capacity by 6.0% due to elevation.
Effective Capacity: 75,200 BTU/hr
Files to Modify

client/src/lib/sizing-engine.ts - Add calculation logic
UI form components - Add elevation input field
Equipment display components - Add derating message
Ensure elevation data flows from input → calculation → display

Please implement this elevation derating feature with the exact calculation formula and display text specified above.
